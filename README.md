# Welcome to python-practice!
This is a repo for practicing Python. It is just a simple place for me to learn the language. 
Eventually, this repo will contain a variety of projects. I'm still new to GitHub and programming in general, so this is a learning space for me.

# What Currently Exists Here
For starters, here is what I have created:
- A simple (obligatory) "Hello World!" script.
- A simple poem GUI app, where you can submit a quick poem!

# What I Want to Create Here
Eventually, I want to develop **entire programs** within this project. For now, I _only_ have a simple test script. 

I want to build:
- An item checker.
- A script that calls an API.
- An account viewer.
- And more!

I may do some of my past assignments from school over again and post them here. I had fun working on them back then and I think it would be fun to do them again!

For learning purposes only. Not to be taken (too) seriously.
