This is a repo for practicing Python. This repo will contain a variety of projects.

For starters, here is what I have created:
- A simple (obligatory) "Hello World!" script.
- A simple poem GUI app, where you can submit a quick poem!

## Note
For learning purposes only. Not to be taken (too) seriously.
